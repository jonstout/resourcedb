This library is responsible for providing a separate "Admin" interface to the ResourceDB GWS methods (the read-write 
methods). It only allows access to the methods that authenticated users are allowed to use. It registers GRNOC::WebService::Method 
instances to the dispatcher object to make all of the webservice methods and their callback behavior available.
